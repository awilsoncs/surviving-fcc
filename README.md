# Front End Projects

Free Code Camp is well known for its thorough projects compared to other web-dev learning resources.

## Make some design decisions

Be warned, I am not a designer. I follow a system and it makes reasonable-looking apps. It's nothing groundbreaking or professional.

### Color Schemes

* [flatuicolorpicker.com](http://www.flatuicolorpicker.com/)
* [colourlovers.com](http://www.colourlovers.com/)

You need five colors:

* 2 muted similar colors
* 1 bright, contrasting color
* 1 near black color (charcoal, or a darker version of one of the above). Neutral tones are fine.
* 1 near white color (very light version of your black-like). Neutral tones are fine.

Ignore color psychology. There's no real evidence it works. Pick colors that look good.

### Fonts

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

You need:

* Headings. You should use a serif font here.
* Body text. You should use a sans serif font here.
* Monospace content (code) if needed. Use a monospace font.

You can read more about choosing fonts [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/11/best-practices-of-combining-typefaces/)

### Mockup

I use [Moqups](https://moqups.com/), but I have to finish a design and screenshot it, since they only allow one project on the free account.

You can set up color ID circles and width measures in Moqup. You can also add text blocks with descriptions of behavior. Add as much information to this mockup as possible, because anything you decide now will make your life easier later.

# Set up imports in Codepen

Go to Codepen and create a new project. Click the settings next to HTML and change these:

* **HTML:** No change
* **CSS:** 
  * CSS preprocessor -> SCSS.
  * CSS base -> Reset
  * External CSS -> (see below)
* **JS:** If your site is interactive, quick add Angular.

4. Set up boilerplate CSS
5. Set up boilerplate HTML
6. Built a static version of your site.
7. Hook everything up via Angular.
